# Sea Star Wasting Disease RNA-sequencing study

This repository holds data and code associated with Sea Star Wasting Disease RNA-seq study led by Melanie Lloyd and Melissa Pespeni.

93 samples were taken from 24 individuals, eight of these individuals ended the experiment healthy and 16 became sick. 
Each library was uniquely barcoded and all libraries were sequenced across 4 Illumina HiSeq 3000 lanes (2x100bp).
